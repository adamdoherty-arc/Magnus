TOP FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

USER COMPLAINTS (Top 3):
1. Poor Context Memory (forget previous conversations)
2. Slow Response Times (abandon if > 5 seconds)
3. Overconfident Wrong Answers (hallucination kills trust)

USER PRAISE (Top 3):
1. Context Memory and Continuity
2. Speed and Responsiveness
3. Multimodal Input/Output (voice, text, image)

BEST PRACTICES (Top 3):
1. Show confidence scores and reasoning always
2. Ask clarifying questions instead of guessing
3. Integrate with real systems (portfolio, market data)

================================================================================
