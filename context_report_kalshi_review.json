  "summary": "Comprehensive Kalshi prediction markets integration review completed. System is PRODUCTION READY with 5 client implementations. Identified major optimization opportunity: migrate all sync scripts from authenticated session tokens to public API (no auth required). Created detailed migration guide and implementation plan. All read operations (100% of current usage) can use public API, eliminating session token expiration issues and manual refresh overhead.",
