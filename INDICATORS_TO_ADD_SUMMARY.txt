===========================================
INDICATORS TO ADD - QUICK REFERENCE
===========================================

Based on research of institutional trading and successful GitHub projects.

PRIORITY 1: SMART MONEY CONCEPTS (ICT)
---------------------------------------
These show WHERE and WHY institutions trade.

1. ORDER BLOCKS (OB)
   - What: Last candle before major reversal
   - Why: Shows institutional entry points
   - Signal: High-probability entry zones
   - GitHub: smartmoneyconcepts package
   - Install: pip install smartmoneyconcepts

2. FAIR VALUE GAPS (FVG)
   - What: Price imbalances (gaps between candles)
   - Why: Usually filled before trend continues
   - Signal: Retracement zones
   - Impact: FVG in demand zone = very strong buy

3. BREAK OF STRUCTURE (BOS) / CHANGE OF CHARACTER (CHOCH)
   - What: Confirms trend direction changes
   - Why: Shows smart money shifting direction
   - Signal: Trend reversal confirmation
   - Impact: CHoCH + demand zone = reversal setup

4. LIQUIDITY POOLS
   - What: Stop loss clusters (above highs, below lows)
   - Why: Institutions sweep liquidity before reversing
   - Signal: Potential reversal zones
   - Impact: Liquidity sweep + fresh zone = high-probability

PRIORITY 2: VOLUME PROFILE
---------------------------
Shows WHERE most trading volume occurred.

5. POINT OF CONTROL (POC)
   - What: Price level with highest volume
   - Why: Acts as magnet for price
   - Signal: Price returns to POC often
   - GitHub: py-market-profile
   - Install: pip install market-profile

6. VALUE AREA (VA)
   - What: Range containing 70% of volume
   - Why: "Fair value" zone
   - Signal: VAH = resistance, VAL = support
   - Impact: Zone at VA = strong level

7. HIGH/LOW VOLUME NODES (HVN/LVN)
   - What: Areas of high/low volume
   - Why: HVN = support/resistance, LVN = fast moves
   - Signal: Zone at HVN = very strong
   - Impact: +15 points to zone strength

PRIORITY 3: MOMENTUM & CONFIRMATION
------------------------------------
Confirms zone quality and trend direction.

8. RSI (RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX)
   - What: Overbought/oversold indicator
   - Why: Confirms zone strength
   - Signal: RSI < 30 + demand zone = strong buy
   - Library: TA-Lib or pandas
   - Impact: +10 points if oversold/overbought

9. MACD (MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE DIVERGENCE)
   - What: Trend and momentum indicator
   - Why: Confirms trend direction
   - Signal: MACD cross + zone = high-probability
   - Impact: +10 points if aligned

10. MOVING AVERAGES (EMA 20, 50, 200)
    - What: Trend direction and support/resistance
    - Why: Institutional levels
    - Signal: Bullish alignment = uptrend
    - Impact: +10 points if aligned
    - Key: Price above EMA 200 = long bias

PRIORITY 4: ADVANCED CONCEPTS
------------------------------
Professional-grade analysis tools.

11. ATR (AVERAGE TRUE RANGE)
    - What: Volatility measure
    - Why: Sets proper stop losses and targets
    - Signal: Stop = zone - (1.5 x ATR)
    - Impact: Better risk management

12. CUMULATIVE VOLUME DELTA (CVD)
    - What: Buying volume - selling volume
    - Why: Shows institutional accumulation/distribution
    - Signal: CVD rising + demand = accumulation
    - Impact: +10 points if confirming

13. FIBONACCI RETRACEMENTS
    - What: Key retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)
    - Why: Natural retracement areas
    - Signal: Demand at 61.8% Fib = golden zone
    - Impact: +10 points at key Fib level
