# Opportunities - TODO List

## 🔴 High Priority (Current Sprint)

### Critical Issues
- [ ] Improve scanning speed (currently 2-3 minutes for 100 symbols, target: < 60s)
- [ ] Fix 15-minute delayed data issue (Yahoo Finance free tier limitation)
- [ ] Add automatic earnings date filtering to avoid earnings surprises
- [ ] Improve delta calculation accuracy (currently simplified Black-Scholes)
- [ ] Fix rate limiting handling for Yahoo Finance API

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement real-time WebSocket streaming for live opportunity updates
- [ ] Add earnings calendar integration for automatic filtering
- [ ] Improve liquidity validation (current thresholds may be too lenient)
- [ ] Add dividend adjustment to Greek calculations
- [ ] Implement better error handling for missing/invalid symbols

## 🟡 Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

### User Experience
- [ ] Add saved scan configurations (save filter presets)
- [ ] Implement natural language search ("show trades over 2% monthly return")
- [ ] Add advanced filter builder UI with visual query construction
- [ ] Create quick filter sidebar for common searches
- [ ] Implement regex support for power users
- [ ] Add position grouping by symbol, expiration, or strategy

### Performance
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for 10x scan speed improvement
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer for faster rescans
- [ ] Optimize Greek calculations with vectorization
- [ ] Create materialized views for database-first scanning
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for detailed analysis

### Analytics
- [ ] Add multi-timeframe analysis (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y trends)
- [ ] Implement market regime detection (bull/bear/sideways/high-vol/low-vol)
- [ ] Add options Greeks surface modeling (3D visualization)
- [ ] Create volatility surface visualization
- [ ] Add market correlation analysis

## 🟢 Low Priority (Backlog)

### Machine Learning
- [ ] Implement ML-based opportunity scoring (success rate prediction)
- [ ] Add anomaly detection system for unusual market conditions
- [ ] Create NLP for news impact analysis
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning for trade optimization
- [ ] Add pattern recognition for historical winning setups

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Build holistic portfolio optimization (consider entire portfolio)
- [ ] Add tax optimization intelligence (after-tax returns)
- [ ] Create multi-leg strategy scanner (spreads, condors, butterflies)
- [ ] Implement backtesting engine for strategy validation
- [ ] Add sector/industry filtering and analysis

### Integrations
- [ ] Add options flow intelligence (unusual activity detection)
- [ ] Integrate alternative data sources (sentiment, satellite, credit card)
- [ ] Add Discord/Slack notifications for new opportunities
- [ ] Implement auto-trading integration (with safety controls)
- [ ] Create RESTful API for programmatic access

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Data Quality
- **15-minute delayed data** - Yahoo Finance free tier limitation
- **No automatic earnings filtering** - Must check manually
- **Delta calculations lack dividend adjustment** - Inaccurate for dividend stocks
- **Historical performance not tracked** - Can't see recommendation success rate

### Performance
- **Scanning 100+ symbols takes 2-3 minutes** - Too slow for active trading
- **No real-time price updates** - Data can become stale quickly
- **Rate limiting not handled gracefully** - Causes scan failures

### User Interface
- **No strategy templates** - Users must configure from scratch every time
- **Results not cached** - Every filter change rescans
- **No saved searches** - Must re-enter criteria
- **Export limited to CSV** - No Excel or PDF options

## 📝 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor scanner.py (break monolithic class into modules)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (target: 80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Create integration tests with mock APIs
- [ ] Improve error handling with specific exception types
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Implement TypeScript for type safety

### Architecture
- [ ] Migrate to microservices architecture
- [ ] Implement event-driven design with message queue
- [ ] Add GraphQL API layer
- [ ] Create distributed processing with Celery workers
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for API failures

### Database
- [ ] Add database caching for opportunities
- [ ] Create indexes for common queries
- [ ] Implement materialized views
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring
- [ ] Create data archival strategy

## 🧪 Testing Needed

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Symbol validation logic
- [ ] Premium calculations (all formulas)
- [ ] Delta calculations (Black-Scholes)
- [ ] Liquidity validation thresholds
- [ ] Return metrics (monthly, annual)
- [ ] Opportunity scoring algorithm

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Yahoo Finance API integration
- [ ] TradingView watchlist loading
- [ ] Database scanner integration
- [ ] Strategy template application
- [ ] Filter logic accuracy
- [ ] CSV export functionality

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Single symbol scan (< 2s target)
- [ ] 10 symbol scan (< 20s target)
- [ ] 100 symbol scan (< 3min target)
- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Concurrent user handling

## 📚 Documentation

### Missing
- [ ] API documentation for scanning engine
- [ ] Strategy template creation guide
- [ ] Filtering logic explanation
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Error handling reference

### Incomplete
- [ ] README needs more examples
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE missing data flow diagrams
- [ ] SPEC needs detailed API specifications
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create video tutorials
