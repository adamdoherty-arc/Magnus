## Overview

The Opportunities feature is your intelligent options trading assistant, designed to identify the most profitable cash-secured put (CSP) opportunities for the wheel strategy. It systematically scans the market to find options with optimal risk-reward ratios, helping you maximize returns while managing risk effectively.

### What It Does

The feature performs three core functions:

1. **Market Scanning**: Analyzes multiple stocks to find those with attractive option premiums
2. **Opportunity Ranking**: Evaluates and ranks opportunities based on return potential
3. **Risk Assessment**: Filters opportunities based on liquidity and assignment risk

### Key Benefits

- **Time Efficiency**: Automates hours of manual research into seconds
- **Objective Analysis**: Removes emotional bias from trade selection
- **Return Optimization**: Identifies the highest-yielding opportunities within your risk parameters
- **Liquidity Focus**: Ensures you only see tradable opportunities with sufficient volume

## Understanding Premium Opportunities

### The Wheel Strategy Context

In the wheel strategy, finding the right entry point is crucial. The Opportunities feature focuses on:

1. **Cash-Secured Puts (CSPs)**: The foundation of the wheel strategy
2. **Premium Collection**: Maximizing income while waiting for assignment
3. **Strike Selection**: Balancing premium income with assignment probability

### What Makes a Good Opportunity

The system evaluates opportunities based on multiple factors:

#### 1. Premium Percentage
- **Definition**: Premium received as a percentage of strike price
- **Target Range**: 1-3% for monthly options (30 DTE)
- **Significance**: Higher percentages mean better capital efficiency

#### 2. Annualized Return
- **Calculation**: (Premium % / Days to Expiry) Ã— 365
- **Good Range**: 12-36% annually
- **Reality Check**: Consider assignment risk at higher returns

#### 3. Implied Volatility (IV)
- **Sweet Spot**: 30-60% IV
- **Too Low (<20%)**: Minimal premiums
- **Too High (>80%)**: Excessive risk, possible underlying issues

#### 4. Liquidity Metrics
- **Volume**: Minimum 100 contracts daily
- **Open Interest**: At least 50 contracts
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: Should be less than 10% of premium

### Delta and Strike Selection

The system focuses on out-of-the-money (OTM) puts with specific characteristics:

- **Target Delta**: -0.20 to -0.30 (20-30% probability of assignment)
- **Strike Range**: 5-10% below current stock price
- **Rationale**: Balances premium income with assignment probability
