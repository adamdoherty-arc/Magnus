# Enhancement Agent - Feature Health Monitor & Improvement Recommender

## Overview

The **Enhancement Agent** is a meta-feature that monitors all Magnus features, tracks their health, analyzes TODOs, and recommends improvements. It runs daily to keep all features optimized and up-to-date with modern frameworks.

## What It Does

- **📊 Feature Health Dashboard** - Real-time status of all 11 features
- **📝 TODO Aggregation** - Consolidated view of all feature TODOs
- **🎯 Improvement Recommendations** - AI-powered suggestions for enhancements
- **🔍 Code Analysis** - Detects outdated patterns, missing tests, tech debt
- **📈 Usage Analytics** - Tracks which features are most/least used
- **🤖 Auto-Discovery** - Finds opportunities for new features
- **📅 Daily Reports** - Automated daily health checks and updates

## Quick Access

**Navigation**: Right sidebar → "🔧 Enhancement Agent"

## Features

### 1. Feature Health Dashboard
```
Feature Status Overview:
✅ Positions (100%) - 3 pending tasks
✅ AI Research (95%) - In development
⚠️  Calendar Spreads (70%) - Needs testing
🔴 Database Scan (50%) - Performance issues
```

### 2. Consolidated TODO View
See ALL todos from ALL features in one place:
- Filter by priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Filter by feature
- Sort by age, complexity
- Mark items complete across features

### 3. AI-Powered Recommendations
```
💡 Recommendations for Positions Feature:
1. Add WebSocket for real-time updates (High Priority)
2. Implement position notes feature (Medium)
3. Upgrade to latest Streamlit patterns (Low)

Estimated Impact: +25% user satisfaction
Effort: 2-3 days
Frameworks: FastAPI WebSockets, Streamlit 1.32+
```

### 4. Modern Framework Suggestions
Automatically suggests when:
- New versions of dependencies available
- Better frameworks emerge (e.g., LangChain → LangGraph)
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance improvements possible

### 5. Daily Automation
Runs every night at 2:00 AM:
- Scans all feature folders
- Reads TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, AGENT.md
- Analyzes code for patterns
- Generates health report
- Updates Enhancement Agent page

## How It Works

### Daily Scan Process
```
1. Read all features/ folders
2. Parse documentation files
3. Analyze code quality
4. Check for updates (npm, pip)
5. Generate recommendations
6. Update dashboard
7. Send digest (optional email/Slack)
```

### AI Analysis
Uses LangChain + CrewAI agents:
- **Code Analyzer Agent** - Scans for anti-patterns
- **Framework Scout Agent** - Finds modern alternatives
- **Priority Agent** - Ranks recommendations
- **Documentation Agent** - Ensures docs are current

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- LangChain, CrewAI (already installed for AI Research)
- Access to all feature folders
- Cron job or Windows Task Scheduler

### Installation
```bash
# Already installed with AI Research dependencies
pip install langchain crewai

# Setup daily scan
python setup_enhancement_agent.py
```

### Configuration
```env
# .env settings
ENHANCEMENT_AGENT_ENABLED=true
ENHANCEMENT_AGENT_SCHEDULE=0 2 * * *  # 2 AM daily
ENHANCEMENT_AGENT_NOTIFY_EMAIL=your@email.com  # Optional
```
