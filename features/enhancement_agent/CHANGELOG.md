## Migration Notes

### From Manual Monitoring to Enhancement Agent

When Enhancement Agent is deployed, teams should:

1. **Baseline Current State**: Run initial scan to establish baseline
2. **Review Recommendations**: Prioritize high-impact suggestions
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all features have required .md files
4. **Configure Preferences**: Set notification and scan preferences
5. **Train Team**: Review dashboard and recommendation workflow

### Breaking Changes

#### Version 2.0.0
- Database schema changes will require migration
- API endpoints will move from /api/v1 to /api/v2
- Configuration file format will change

#### Version 3.0.0
- Multi-agent architecture will replace single coordinator
- New dependency on Kubernetes for scaling

## Deprecation Notices

### Version 2.0.0
- Manual health checks will be deprecated
- Legacy TODO tracking in spreadsheets should migrate

### Version 3.0.0
- REST API v1 will be deprecated in favor of GraphQL

## Performance Improvements

### Version 1.1.0
