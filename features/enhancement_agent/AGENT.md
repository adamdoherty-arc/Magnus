## Error Handling

### File System Errors
```python
try:
    with open(f"/features/{feature}/TODO.md", 'r') as f:
        todos = parse_todos(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    log.info(f"No TODO.md found for {feature}")
    todos = []
except PermissionError as e:
    log.error(f"Permission denied reading {feature}: {e}")
    # Use cached data if available
    todos = get_cached_todos(feature)
```

### API Rate Limiting
```python
try:
    latest_version = check_pypi_version(package)
except RateLimitException:
    log.warning("PyPI rate limit reached")
    # Implement exponential backoff
    time.sleep(2 ** retry_count)
    return check_with_backoff(package, retry_count + 1)
```

### AI Model Failures
```python
try:
    recommendations = ai_model.generate(prompt)
except OpenAIError as e:
    log.error(f"AI model error: {e}")
    # Fall back to rule-based recommendations
    recommendations = generate_rule_based_recommendations()
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- **Feature Health Cache**: 24-hour TTL
  - Key: `enhancement:health:{feature}:{date}`
  - Size: ~1KB per feature

- **Recommendation Cache**: 7-day TTL
  - Key: `enhancement:recs:{feature}:{week}`
  - Size: ~10KB per feature

- **Dependency Version Cache**: 12-hour TTL
  - Key: `enhancement:deps:{package}`
  - Size: ~100 bytes per package

### Optimization
- Parallel scanning using asyncio
- Batch database inserts (100 records at a time)
- Lazy loading of analysis results
- Incremental scanning for git changes only
- Connection pooling for database access
