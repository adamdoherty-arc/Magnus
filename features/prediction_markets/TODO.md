## üêõ Known Issues

- **Manual refresh required** - No real-time updates (WebSocket needed)
- **No portfolio tracking** - Can't see user positions or P&L
- **No alerts** - Must manually check for opportunities
- **Top 20 display limit** - Performance optimization, but limits visibility
- **1-hour cache** - Data can be stale, especially during volatile periods
- **Rate limit risk** - Need to increase cache TTL or implement better throttling
- **Simplified expected value** - Assumes efficient markets, may not be accurate
- **No historical data** - Only current active markets visible
- **No news integration** - Missing important context for events

## üìù Technical Debt

- [ ] Optimize scoring algorithm (vectorization)
- [ ] Add database persistence for markets and trades
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## üß™ Testing Needed

- [ ] Market fetching from Kalshi API
- [ ] Orderbook data parsing
- [ ] Scoring algorithm accuracy
- [ ] Recommendation logic correctness
- [ ] Risk assessment accuracy
- [ ] Expected value calculations
- [ ] Filter application (category, score, days)
- [ ] Cache behavior (TTL, invalidation)
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance
- [ ] Error handling (API failures, missing data)

## üìö Documentation

- [ ] Add strategy guide for prediction markets
- [ ] Document scoring algorithm in detail
- [ ] Create video tutorials for beginners
- [ ] Write API documentation

```

## üîî Alert System Design

### Alert Types
- **Price Alerts**: Market price crosses threshold
- **Score Alerts**: New high-scoring market discovered
- **Volume Alerts**: Unusual trading activity
- **Position Alerts**: P&L threshold reached
- **Event Alerts**: Market closing soon
- **Arbitrage Alerts**: Cross-platform price differences

### Delivery Channels

- SMS (Twilio)
- Push Notifications (Firebase)
- Discord Webhooks
- Slack Webhooks
- In-App Notifications

### Alert Configuration
- User-defined thresholds

- Quiet hours (night mode)
- Channel preferences
- Alert priority levels
- Snooze functionality

## üîÑ Real-Time Updates Implementation

### WebSocket Strategy
```python
# Connect to Kalshi WebSocket (if available)
async def stream_market_updates():
    async with websocket.connect('wss://api.kalshi.com/stream') as ws:
        # Subscribe to markets
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            'action': 'subscribe',
            'markets': user_tracked_markets
        }))

        # Stream updates
        async for message in ws:
            data = json.loads(message)
            update_ui(data)
```

### Fallback: Polling Strategy
```python
# If WebSocket not available, use smart polling
def smart_polling():
    # Poll active markets every 30 seconds
    # Poll tracked positions every 10 seconds
    # Use exponential backoff on errors
    # Respect rate limits
```

## üìà Portfolio Tracking Specification

### Data Model
```python
class Position:
    market_id: str
    market_title: str
    side: str  # 'Yes' or 'No'
    entry_price: float
    quantity: int
    entry_date: datetime
    current_price: float
    unrealized_pnl: float
    realized_pnl: float
    status: str  # 'Open', 'Closed', 'Settled'
```

### Features
- Real-time P&L calculation
- Position history and trade log
- Performance metrics (win rate, avg return)
- Risk metrics (max drawdown, VaR)
- Tax reporting (cost basis, gains/losses)
- Export to CSV/Excel
