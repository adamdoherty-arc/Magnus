# Premium Scanner - TODO List

## 🔴 High Priority (Current Sprint)

### Critical Fixes
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time data updates (replace 15-min delayed data)
- [ ] Fix scanning performance (100 symbols in 3-5 min, target: < 60s)
- [ ] Add multi-expiration support improvements (currently 6 DTEs: 7,14,21,30,45,60)
- [ ] Improve Black-Scholes delta calculations (add dividend adjustment)
- [ ] Fix Robinhood rate limiting handling

### Core Features
- [ ] Add earnings calendar integration for automatic filtering
- [ ] Implement portfolio integration (show current positions, BP impact)
- [ ] Add real-time Greeks display (gamma, vega, rho beyond delta)
- [ ] Improve liquidity validation (current thresholds may miss illiquid options)
- [ ] Add assignment risk monitoring

## 🟡 Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

### User Experience
- [ ] Create advanced filtering interface (visual query builder)
- [ ] Add saved scan configurations (filter presets)
- [ ] Implement customizable dashboard layout
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Create dark mode theme
- [ ] Build interactive tutorial system

### Performance
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for 10x performance boost
- [ ] Add parallel processing for symbol scanning
- [ ] Optimize database queries with materialized views
- [ ] Implement incremental loading/virtual scrolling
- [ ] Add smart caching with predictive prefetching

### Analytics
- [ ] Add machine learning predictions for opportunity scoring
- [ ] Implement historical performance backtesting
- [ ] Create volatility surface visualization (3D IV charts)
- [ ] Add multi-timeframe analysis
- [ ] Build market regime detection

## 🟢 Low Priority (Backlog)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement multi-strategy support (credit spreads, iron condors, PMCC)
- [ ] Add advanced risk analytics (VaR, CVaR, Kelly Criterion)
- [ ] Create automated trading integration (with safety controls)
- [ ] Build strategy backtesting engine with Monte Carlo
- [ ] Add AI-powered trade recommendations

### Integrations
- [ ] Support additional brokers (TD, IBKR, E*TRADE, Schwab, Fidelity)
- [ ] Add market data providers (Polygon, IEX, Alpha Vantage)
- [ ] Integrate news & sentiment analysis
- [ ] Add options flow intelligence
- [ ] Build Discord/Slack notifications

### Mobile & API
- [ ] Develop native mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Create REST API for programmatic access
- [ ] Build browser extension
- [ ] Add webhook support
- [ ] Develop SDK (Python, JavaScript, Go)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **15-minute delayed data** - Robinhood free tier limitation
- **Scanning 100 symbols takes 3-5 minutes** - Performance bottleneck
- **Delta calculations don't include dividends** - Causes inaccuracy
- **No automatic earnings filtering** - Manual checking required
- **Database can grow large** - Needs periodic cleanup
- **Background sync not visible in UI** - User confusion
- **Limited to US equities only** - No international markets

## 📝 Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor monolithic scanner class into modular components
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 60% to 90%+
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery
- [ ] Optimize database schema with partitioning
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

## 🧪 Testing Needed

- [ ] Single symbol scan (all 6 DTEs)
- [ ] Bulk scanning (10, 50, 100 symbols)
- [ ] Delta calculation accuracy verification
- [ ] Return calculation formulas
- [ ] Database upsert handling
- [ ] Background sync completion
- [ ] Error scenarios (API failures, rate limits)

## 📚 Documentation

- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Document Greek calculations
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide
