## üêõ Known Issues

- **Feature is partially implemented** - Core functionality needs completion
- **No active position tracking** - Can't monitor spread performance
- **Manual strike selection required** - No automated recommendations yet
- **No Greeks display** - Missing critical risk metrics
- **No profit/loss diagrams** - Hard to visualize spread outcomes
- **Breakeven calculation missing** - Need precise entry/exit guidance
- **No earnings filtering** - Risk of early assignment on ex-div dates
- **Limited to single calendar spreads** - No diagonal or double calendars

## üìù Technical Debt

## üìä Calendar Spread Strategy Guide

### Ideal Conditions
- **IV Percentile**: < 30% (low volatility environment)
- **Market Type**: Range-bound or slowly trending
- **DTE Pairing**: 30-day front / 60-day back (2:1 ratio)
- **Strike Selection**: ATM or slightly OTM
- **Liquidity**: Volume > 1,000, OI > 5,000, spread < 5%

### Entry Rules
- Enter 30-45 days before front-month expiration
- Avoid earnings in front month
- Check ex-dividend dates
- Confirm IV is below historical average
- Ensure adequate liquidity

### Exit Rules
- **Profit Target**: 25-50% of max profit
- **Stop Loss**: 50% of max loss
- **Time Exit**: 1 week before front-month expiration
- **Event Exit**: Exit before unexpected earnings/events
- **Volatility Exit**: Exit if IV spikes >2 standard deviations

### Position Management
- Monitor daily theta decay
- Watch for price movement outside expected range
- Adjust if stock moves >1.5 standard deviations
- Roll front month if profitable and conditions remain favorable
- Close entire spread if underlying thesis changes
