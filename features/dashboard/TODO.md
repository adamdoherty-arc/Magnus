- [ ] Fix empty state handling when no Robinhood connection

### Core Functionality Improvements
- [ ] Implement automatic trade sync from Robinhood (currently manual entry only)
- [ ] Add duplicate detection and reconciliation for manually entered trades
- [ ] Improve P/L calculation accuracy for edge cases (partial fills, adjustments)
- [ ] Add data validation and sanitization for trade entry forms

## 🟡 Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add dark mode theme support with system preference detection
- [ ] Implement customizable dashboard layout (widget placement, column selection)
- [ ] Add advanced filtering for trade history (date ranges, strategy types, profit thresholds)
- [ ] Create saved filter presets for quick access
- [ ] Add interactive tutorial system for new users
- [ ] Implement natural language search ("show me trades over 50% profit")

### Performance & Analytics
- [ ] Add real-time WebSocket updates (replace polling)
- [ ] Implement advanced caching layer (Redis multi-tier: Memory → Redis → Database)
- [ ] Add Monte Carlo simulation for advanced forecasting
- [ ] Implement performance analytics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- [ ] Add benchmark comparisons (SPY, QQQ)
- [ ] Optimize database queries for faster data retrieval

### Alert System
- [ ] Build comprehensive alerting system with multiple delivery channels
- [ ] Add profit target alerts (customizable thresholds)
- [ ] Implement assignment risk warnings (ITM approaching expiration)
- [ ] Add theta acceleration zone notifications
- [ ] Implement earnings announcement alerts for held positions
- [ ] Add email alert integration
- [ ] Add SMS notifications (Twilio integration)
- [ ] Add Discord/Slack webhook support

## 🟢 Low Priority (Backlog)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop trade management (Kanban board view)
- [ ] Add TradingView advanced charts integration
- [ ] Build tax reporting module (Form 8949, Schedule D, wash sale detection)
- [ ] Add options strategy builder (visual P&L diagrams)
- [ ] Implement AI-powered trade journal with pattern recognition
- [ ] Add voice-controlled trading assistant integration
- [ ] Build multi-account support (multiple brokerages)

### Mobile & Cross-Platform
- [ ] Develop native mobile application (React Native or Flutter)
- [ ] Add push notifications for mobile app
- [ ] Implement biometric authentication
- [ ] Add offline mode with sync capability
- [ ] Create home screen widgets for key metrics

### Integrations
- [ ] Add support for TD Ameritrade / Schwab
- [ ] Integrate with E*TRADE
- [ ] Add Interactive Brokers support
- [ ] Implement Tastytrade integration
- [ ] Build community features (trade sharing, leaderboards)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Data Accuracy
- **Assignment probability uses basic approximation** - Need to implement full Black-Scholes with dividend adjustments
- **Forecasts assume 70% expire worthless** - Static probability needs market-condition awareness
- **Historical performance only shows completed trades** - Missing open position impact on metrics

### Performance Issues
- **Page load times can be slow (2s+)** - Need to implement caching and optimize queries
- **Large trade history (100+ trades) causes lag** - Implement pagination and lazy loading
- **Forecast calculations block UI** - Move to background workers

### User Experience
- **Trade history requires manual entry** - Auto-sync needed
- **No conflict resolution for duplicate entries** - Need deduplication algorithm
- **Limited error messages for failed operations** - Improve user feedback

## 📝 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Migrate to TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit testing (target: >80% coverage)
- [ ] Add integration test suite for critical flows
- [ ] Refactor dashboard.py (lines 124-349) into modular components
- [ ] Extract forecast logic into separate service
- [ ] Improve error handling with proper exception hierarchy
- [ ] Add code documentation generation (Sphinx/MkDocs)

### Architecture
- [ ] Migrate to microservices architecture for scalability
- [ ] Implement event-driven architecture with message queue
- [ ] Create GraphQL API layer for flexible querying
- [ ] Add distributed tracing for debugging
- [ ] Implement service mesh for microservices communication
- [ ] Add container orchestration with Kubernetes

### Database
- [ ] Optimize trade_history table indexes
- [ ] Implement materialized views for analytics
- [ ] Add partitioning for large tables
- [ ] Improve connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Add query performance dashboard
- [ ] Implement slow query alerts

### Security
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication
- [ ] Add end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Conduct security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance
- [ ] Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Implement API key management system

## 🧪 Testing Needed

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Trade P/L calculations (all edge cases)
- [ ] Balance forecast logic (best/expected/worst scenarios)
- [ ] Theta decay projections (time-based decay)
- [ ] AI recommendation thresholds (profit targets)
- [ ] Assignment probability calculations
- [ ] Annualized return formulas
- [ ] Breakeven price calculations

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Positions data sync from Positions Agent
- [ ] Account data updates from Settings changes
- [ ] Trade history persistence to database
- [ ] Forecasts update when positions close
- [ ] Robinhood API integration (with mocks)
- [ ] Error handling for API failures

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly without connection
- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly with connection
- [ ] Multiple concurrent users don't interfere
- [ ] Data persists across sessions
- [ ] Performance with 1000+ trades
