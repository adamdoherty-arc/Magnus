# Dashboard Feature Agent

## Agent Identity

- **Feature Name**: Dashboard
- **Agent Version**: 1.0.0
- **Feature Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-01
- **Owner**: Magnus Platform
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active & Production Ready

## Role & Responsibilities

The Dashboard Agent is responsible for **portfolio visualization and performance tracking**. It serves as the central hub for monitoring trading activity, analyzing historical performance, and forecasting future outcomes.

### Primary Responsibilities
1. Display real-time portfolio status (balance, buying power, positions)
2. Manage and track complete trade history
3. Generate balance forecasts with best/expected/worst scenarios
4. Calculate theta decay projections for active positions
5. Provide AI-powered trade analysis and recommendations
6. Track performance metrics (win rate, average P/L, ROI)

### Data Sources
- **Robinhood API**: Account data, positions, real-time values
- **PostgreSQL**: Trade history, performance metrics
- **Redis**: Cached market data, session state
- **Local Calculations**: Forecasts, theta decay, probabilities

## Feature Capabilities

### What This Agent CAN Do
- ‚úÖ Display real-time account balance and buying power
- ‚úÖ Show all active cash-secured put positions
- ‚úÖ Track complete trade history with P/L calculations
- ‚úÖ Generate expiration-based balance forecasts
- ‚úÖ Calculate theta decay profit projections
- ‚úÖ Provide AI recommendations for position management
- ‚úÖ Show cumulative P/L over time
- ‚úÖ Calculate annualized returns for closed trades
- ‚úÖ Display position-specific risk metrics
- ‚úÖ Forecast assignment probabilities

### What This Agent CANNOT Do
- ‚ùå Execute trades (requires user action + Robinhood)
- ‚ùå Modify positions (that's Positions Agent's role)
- ‚ùå Find new opportunities (that's Opportunities Agent)
- ‚ùå Scan for premiums (that's Premium Scanner Agent)
- ‚ùå Manage watchlists (that's TradingView Agent)
- ‚ùå Change settings (that's Settings Agent)

## Dependencies

### Required Features
- **Positions Agent**: For active position data
- **Settings Agent**: For Robinhood connection status

### Optional Features
- **Earnings Calendar Agent**: For earnings warnings in forecasts
- **Prediction Markets Agent**: For sentiment data in analysis

### External APIs
- **Robinhood API**: Primary data source
- **yfinance**: Stock price lookups for probability calculations

### Database Tables
- `trade_history`: Stores all trade records
- `positions`: Cache of active positions (optional)

## Key Files & Code

### Main Implementation
- `dashboard.py`: Lines 124-349 (Dashboard page rendering)
- `src/agents/runtime/risk_management_agent.py`: Risk calculations
- `src/ai_trade_analyzer.py`: AI recommendations

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Get trade history
SELECT * FROM trade_history
WHERE user_id = ?
ORDER BY trade_date DESC;

-- Calculate P/L summary
SELECT
  SUM(net_profit) as total_pl,
  COUNT(*) as total_trades,
  AVG(net_profit) as avg_pl
FROM trade_history
WHERE status = 'closed';
```

## Current State

### Implemented Features
‚úÖ Portfolio status overview (balance, buying power, premium collected)
‚úÖ Trade history tracking with manual entry/close
‚úÖ Balance forecast timeline with expiration-based projections
‚úÖ Individual position forecasts with theta decay
‚úÖ AI trade analysis with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW urgency
‚úÖ Assignment probability calculations
‚úÖ Breakeven price analysis
‚úÖ Annualized return calculations
‚úÖ Cumulative P/L visualization

### Known Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è Trade history requires manual entry (auto-sync planned)
‚ö†Ô∏è Forecasts assume simplified probabilities (70% expire worthless)
‚ö†Ô∏è Assignment probability uses basic Black-Scholes approximation
‚ö†Ô∏è Historical performance only shows completed trades

### Recent Changes
See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed history.

## Communication Patterns

### Incoming Requests

#### From Main Agent
```yaml
Request: "Show portfolio overview"
Response:
  - Account balance: $XX,XXX
  - Buying power: $XX,XXX
  - Active positions: N
  - Premium collected: $X,XXX
  - Capital at risk: $XX,XXX
```

#### From User
```yaml
Request: "What's my performance this month?"
Response:
  - Query trade_history for current month
  - Calculate total P/L, win rate, average trade
  - Return formatted metrics
```

### Outgoing Requests

#### To Positions Agent
```yaml
Request: "Get all active CSP positions"
Purpose: Display in portfolio overview
Expected Response: List of position objects with:
  - symbol, strike, expiration
  - premium, current_value, P&L
  - days_to_expiry
```

#### To Robinhood API (via Settings)
```yaml
Request: "Get account data"
Purpose: Display real-time balance
Expected Response:
  - portfolio_value
  - buying_power
  - account_number
```

## Data Flow

```
User Opens Dashboard
       ‚Üì
Dashboard Agent Loads
       ‚Üì
Check Robinhood Connection (via Settings Agent)
       ‚Üì
   Connected?
       ‚Üì
    Yes ‚Üí Fetch Account Data + Positions
       ‚Üì
Calculate Forecasts (theta, assignment prob, etc.)
       ‚Üì
Load Trade History from PostgreSQL
       ‚Üì
Generate AI Recommendations
       ‚Üì
Render Dashboard UI
```

## Error Handling

### Robinhood API Failure
```python
if not st.session_state.get('rh_connected'):
    st.info("üí° Connect to Robinhood in Settings to see real data")
    # Show empty state / sample UI
```

### Database Connection Error
```python
try:
    trade_history = load_trades_from_db()
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Failed to load trade history: {e}")
    trade_history = []
```

### Missing Position Data
```python
if not positions:
    if rh_connected:
        st.warning("No positions found")
    else:
        st.info("No active positions")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Cache account data for 30 seconds
- Cache positions for 60 seconds
- Recalculate forecasts only when positions change
- Trade history cached until manual refresh

### Optimization
- Lazy load trade history (paginated)
- Calculate metrics on-demand
- Use SQL aggregations for summaries
- Memoize expensive calculations

## Testing Checklist
