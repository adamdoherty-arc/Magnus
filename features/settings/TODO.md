## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Session expires without warning** - Need proactive notification
- **MFA code entry confusing** - UI could be clearer
- **No session renewal** - Must re-authenticate after 24 hours
- **Limited error details** - Failures don't explain what went wrong
- **Single account only** - Can't manage multiple brokerages
- **Credentials in .env only** - No GUI for credential management
- **No connection history** - Can't see past login/logout events

## 📝 Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor authentication logic into separate service
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for session management
- [ ] Create integration tests with mock Robinhood API
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management (HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Add logging with PII redaction
- [ ] Create security documentation
- [ ] Implement penetration testing schedule

## 🧪 Testing Needed

- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] MFA flow (SMS, email, TOTP)
- [ ] Session expiration handling
- [ ] Auto-reconnect functionality
- [ ] Disconnect and cache clearing
- [ ] Multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Environment variable loading
- [ ] Session persistence across restarts
- [ ] Connection status indicators

## 📚 Documentation

- [ ] Create security best practices guide
- [ ] Write MFA setup tutorial
- [ ] Document environment variable configuration
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create video walkthrough for first-time setup
- [ ] Document session lifecycle
- [ ] Add FAQ section

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Current Security Measures
- [x] Environment variable storage
- [x] Session token encryption
- [x] 24-hour token expiration
- [x] MFA support
- [ ] Rate limiting (needs implementation)
- [ ] Audit logging (needs implementation)
- [ ] Suspicious activity detection (needs implementation)
- [ ] Two-factor beyond broker (needs implementation)

### Recommended Enhancements
- [ ] Implement bcrypt for password hashing (if storing locally)
- [ ] Add TLS certificate pinning
- [ ] Implement CORS policies
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Create security headers (CSP, HSTS)
- [ ] Implement input validation/sanitization
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Create XSS protection

## 📊 Session Management Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Use environment variables for credentials
- ✅ Enable MFA on broker accounts
- ✅ Rotate passwords every 90 days
- ✅ Monitor session status regularly
- ✅ Disconnect when not actively using
- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Keep .env file out of version control

### DON'T
- ❌ Hard-code credentials
- ❌ Share session tokens
- ❌ Use weak passwords
- ❌ Disable MFA
- ❌ Leave sessions open indefinitely
- ❌ Use same password across platforms
- ❌ Store credentials in browser

## 🔄 Session Lifecycle Management

### Current Flow
```
Login → Authenticate → Store Token (24h) → Use Session → Expire
```

### Proposed Enhanced Flow
```
Login → Authenticate → Store Token →
Use Session → Auto-Renew (before expiration) →
Monitor Activity → Detect Inactivity →
Proactive Warning → User Action/Auto-Logout
```

### Auto-Renewal Logic
- Check session age every hour
- If < 2 hours remaining, attempt renewal
- If renewal fails, notify user
- If user inactive for >1 hour, don't auto-renew
- Log all renewal attempts for audit
