## üêõ Known Issues

### Robinhood Integration
- **Positions require active connection** - No offline mode available
- **15-min delayed data on free tier** - Real-time requires premium
- **Session expires without warning** - Need better session management
- **Rate limiting not handled gracefully** - Causes position load failures

### Calculation Issues
- **Theta forecast uses simplified model** - Doesn't account for gamma effects
- **Assignment probability is basic** - Need Monte Carlo simulation
- **Delta doesn't account for dividends** - Causes inaccuracy for dividend stocks
- **No support for early assignment risk** - Missing ex-dividend date awareness

### User Interface
- **Auto-refresh causes scroll jump** - Meta tag refreshes entire page
- **No position modification** - View-only, can't close from interface
- **Large portfolios (50+ positions) load slowly** - Need optimization
- **Table sorting doesn't persist** - Resets on refresh

### Data Persistence
- **Historical P/L requires Dashboard Agent** - No local tracking
- **No position caching** - Every refresh hits API
- **Session state not persisted** - Lost on browser close

## üìù Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor position display logic (dashboard.py lines 351-1121) into components
