- **Agent Version**: 1.0.0
- **Feature Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-01
- **Owner**: Magnus Platform
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active & Production Ready

## Role & Responsibilities

The Positions Agent is responsible for **real-time options portfolio management and position tracking**. It serves as the operational core for monitoring active wheel strategy trades, calculating profit/loss metrics, and providing AI-powered recommendations for optimal position management.

### Primary Responsibilities

2. Calculate comprehensive P&L metrics for all active positions
3. Generate theta decay forecasts for time value analysis
4. Provide AI-powered exit timing recommendations
5. Monitor assignment risk and moneyness status
6. Track position-specific risk metrics and Greeks
7. Alert users to high-profit opportunities (20%+ thresholds)
8. Support auto-refresh capabilities for hands-free monitoring

### Data Sources
- **Robinhood API**: Primary source for position data, option prices, account values
- **Yahoo Finance**: Supplementary stock price data for probability calculations
- **Local Calculations**: Theta decay projections, P&L metrics, AI recommendations
- **Session State**: Cached position data, refresh settings, alert status

### Required Features
- **Settings Agent**: For Robinhood connection status and credentials
- **Robinhood API**: For position data, pricing, and account information

### Optional Features
- **Earnings Calendar Agent**: For earnings warnings in position analysis
- **Prediction Markets Agent**: For sentiment data in AI recommendations

    Returns: List of position dictionaries with all metrics
    """

# P&L Calculation
def calculate_position_pnl(position):
    """
    Calculates profit/loss metrics
    - Premium collected vs current value
    - Percentage of max profit captured
    - Annualized return calculations
    """

# Theta Decay Forecast
def forecast_theta_decay(position, days_to_expiry):
    """
    Projects option value decay over time
    Uses square root of time model

    """
    Generates AI-powered recommendations
    Evaluates: profit targets, time decay, assignment risk
    Returns: action, risk level, confidence score
    """
```

## Error Handling

### Robinhood API Failure
```python
if not st.session_state.get('rh_connected'):
    st.info("üí° Connect to Robinhood in Settings to see live positions")
    # Show empty state with instructions
```

### Missing Position Data
```python
if not positions or len(positions) == 0:
    if rh_connected:
        st.success("‚úÖ No active positions - Portfolio is clear!")
    else:
        st.info("üìä Connect to Robinhood to view positions")
```

### Calculation Errors
```python
try:
    theta_forecast = calculate_theta_decay(position)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Theta calculation failed for {position['symbol']}: {e}")
    theta_forecast = None  # Graceful degradation
```

### API Rate Limiting
```python
try:
    positions = rh_client.get_wheel_positions()
except RateLimitError:
    st.warning("‚è±Ô∏è API rate limit reached. Please wait a moment.")
    positions = st.session_state.get('cached_positions', [])
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Position data cached in session state
- Cache refreshes on manual refresh or auto-refresh trigger
- Current prices updated independently from position structure
- Theta forecasts calculated on-demand, not stored

### Optimization
- Lazy load theta forecasts (expandable sections)
- Calculate AI analysis only for visible positions
- Use vectorized calculations for P&L (when multiple positions)
- Minimize API calls through intelligent caching

### Response Times
| Operation | Target Time | Current |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Load positions | < 2s | ~1.5s |
| Calculate P&L | < 100ms | ~50ms |
| Theta forecast | < 100ms | ~80ms |
| AI analysis | < 500ms | ~300ms |
| Auto-refresh cycle | < 2s | ~1.5s |
