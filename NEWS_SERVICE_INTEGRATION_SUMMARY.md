# News Service Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated real-time news from **Finnhub** and **Polygon APIs** into the Positions Page with automatic deduplication, caching, and comprehensive error handling.

---

## Step 1: Created News Service âœ“

### File: `/c/Code/WheelStrategy/src/news_service.py`

**Key Features:**
- NewsArticle dataclass for structured data
- NewsService class with three main methods:
  - `get_finnhub_news()` - Fetches from Finnhub API
  - `get_polygon_news()` - Fetches from Polygon API
  - `get_combined_news()` - Combines both sources with deduplication
- Automatic .env file loading for API keys
- Proper timezone handling (UTC) for all datetime objects
- Graceful error handling with logging
- Compatible with and without Streamlit context

**API Configuration:**
```
FINNHUB_API_KEY=c39rsbqad3i9bcobhve0
POLYGON_API_KEY=peRAMicTnZi6GEdxratGhkujvvSgzwmn
```

---

## Step 2: Added News Display Function to Positions Page âœ“

### File: `/c/Code/WheelStrategy/positions_page_improved.py`

**Location:** Line 350 (before show_positions_page() function)

**Function: `display_news_section(symbols)`**

Features:
- Accepts list of stock symbols
- Symbol selector dropdown for choosing which stock to view news for
- Displays articles in expandable containers
- Shows "time ago" for each article (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Displays article source, headline, and summary
- "Read Full Article" button linking to original source
- Handles timezone-aware datetime objects correctly
- Returns empty state message when no news found

Code snippet:
```python
def display_news_section(symbols):
    """
    Display news section for all position symbols

    Args:
        symbols: List of stock ticker symbols to fetch news for
    """
    from src.news_service import NewsService

    st.markdown("---")
    st.markdown("### ðŸ“° Latest Market News")

    # Symbol selector
    selected_symbol = st.selectbox(
        "Select symbol for news:",
        options=symbols,
        key="news_symbol_selector"
    )

    if selected_symbol:
        news_service = NewsService()
        with st.spinner(f"Loading news for {selected_symbol}..."):
            news_articles = news_service.get_combined_news(selected_symbol)

        # Display articles in expandable containers
        for article in news_articles:
            with st.expander(f"ðŸ“„ {article.headline} ({time_ago})", expanded=False):
                # Display source, summary, and read button
                ...
```

---

## Step 3: Integrated News Section into Main Positions Page âœ“

### Location in positions_page_improved.py: Lines 821-842

**Placement:** After AI Research section, before Trade History section

**Integration Code:**
```python
# === NEWS SECTION ===
# Collect all unique symbols for news display
all_news_symbols = set()
for pos in stock_positions_data:
    all_news_symbols.add(pos['symbol_raw'])
# ... (collect from other position types)

if all_news_symbols:
    try:
        display_news_section(sorted(list(all_news_symbols)))
    except Exception as e:
        st.warning(f"Could not load news section: {e}")
```

**Features:**
- Automatically collects all unique symbols from all position types:
  - Stock positions
  - Cash Secured Puts (CSP)
  - Covered Calls (CC)
  - Long Calls
  - Long Puts
- Passes sorted symbol list to display function
- Includes error handling with user-friendly warning message

**Test Output Summary:**
```
Total: 5/5 tests passed

All tests PASSED! News integration is working correctly.
```

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. API Key Management
- Loads from .env file automatically using `dotenv.load_dotenv()`
- Falls back gracefully if keys not available
- Returns empty results if API calls fail

### 2. Timezone Handling
- All datetime objects are timezone-aware (UTC)
- Finnhub timestamps converted from Unix epoch to UTC datetime
- Polygon timestamps parsed from ISO 8601 format
- "Time ago" calculation handles timezone-aware comparisons

### 3. Deduplication
- Normalizes headlines: lowercase, trimmed
- Compares normalized versions to identify duplicates
- Preserves first occurrence, drops duplicates
- Combines articles from both APIs efficiently

### 4. Caching
- 30-minute TTL (configurable)
- Streamlit-aware: uses st.cache_data() when available
- Falls back gracefully in non-Streamlit contexts

### 5. Error Handling
- HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) caught and logged
- Timeout errors handled (10-second timeout)
- Malformed responses handled gracefully
- Article parsing errors don't crash service
- User-facing error messages in Streamlit UI

## Rate Limiting Notes

**Finnhub:**
- Free tier: 60 calls per minute
- No rate limiting observed during testing

**Polygon:**
- Free tier: 5 calls per minute (429 errors occur when exceeded)
- Concurrent calls from test suite hit rate limit
- Production use should implement request queuing if needed

**Recommendation:**
- Consider implementing exponential backoff for retries
- Add request throttling if fetching news for many symbols
- Cache results aggressively (already 30-minute TTL)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Use Finnhub sentiment data when available in paid tier
   - Display sentiment indicator (bullish/bearish/neutral)

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by news category (earnings, SEC filings, etc.)
   - Show only "important" news

3. **Notifications**
   - Alert user when major news breaks
   - Email notifications for significant events

4. **Related Symbols**
   - Show news for related companies
   - Show sector news alongside position news

5. **Integration with AI Research**
   - Link news articles to AI research analysis
   - Show how news impacts recommendations
