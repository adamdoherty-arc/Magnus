  ✓ scikit-learn   (preprocessing, ensemble, utilities)
  ✓ TensorFlow     (LSTM, neural networks)
  ✓ PyTorch        (alternative to TensorFlow)

DATA PROCESSING:
  ✓ Pandas         (primary data manipulation)
  ✓ NumPy          (numerical operations)
  ✓ Polars         (faster alternative, large-scale)

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
  ✓ RoBERTa        (preferred, more accurate)
  ✓ FinBERT        (financial text specific)
  ✓ VADER          (fast baseline)

DATA SOURCES:

================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

MUST DO:
  1. Implement ensemble (minimum 4-5 diverse base models)
  2. Apply temperature scaling calibration (2 lines of code)
  3. Use fractional Kelly (1/4 typical, reduces volatility)
  4. Monitor calibration quality daily (Brier score)
  5. Maintain position limits (5% max per trade)

MUST AVOID:
  1. Full Kelly Criterion sizing (guaranteed ruin)
  2. Single model predictions (too volatile)
  3. Neglecting calibration (overconfident = losses)
  4. Betting >5% per position (volatility multiplied)
  5. Emotion-based decisions (data-driven required)

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

INSIGHT 1: Calibration > Accuracy
  A 53% accurate, well-calibrated system with proper risk management beats
  a 70% accurate single model with poor bankroll management.

INSIGHT 2: Only 3% Profitable
  Long-term success requires disciplined risk management and probability
  calibration, not just high accuracy. Most bettors lose money.

INSIGHT 3: Market Efficiency is High
  Betting markets already incorporate 80%+ of available information. True
  edge is narrow. Focus on finding the remaining 20%.

INSIGHT 4: Ensemble Methods Win
  Stacking ensemble (meta-learner on base models) consistently outperforms
  voting, which outperforms single models.

INSIGHT 5: Feature Engineering Matters
  Domain-specific features are critical. A well-engineered simple model beats
  a poorly-featured complex model every time.
