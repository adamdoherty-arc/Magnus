2. Telegram (optional - for alerts)
   - Add to .env:

     TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

3. Ready to use!

HOW IT WORKS
------------
Green Zones (DEMAND) = BUY zones

- Like TradingView green zones you mentioned

Red Zones (SUPPLY) = SELL zones
- Price rising to red zone = selling opportunity
- Like TradingView yellow zones you mentioned

Strength Score: 0-100
- 85-100 = Excellent (trade these!)
- 70-84 = Good
- 50-69 = Fair (watch only)

# Scan single stock
python supply_demand_scanner_service.py --symbol TSLA

# Scan TradingView watchlist
python supply_demand_scanner_service.py --watchlist default

# Just monitor existing zones (no detection)
python supply_demand_scanner_service.py --monitor-only

# Run on schedule (every 5 min)
python supply_demand_scanner_service.py --scheduled
