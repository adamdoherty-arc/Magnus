# Magnus Main Orchestrator Agent

## Role & Responsibility

The Main Agent is the **primary orchestrator** for the Magnus Trading Platform. It serves as the central intelligence that:

1. **Routes requests** to appropriate feature-specific agents
2. **Coordinates multi-feature workflows** requiring collaboration between agents
3. **Maintains platform-wide context** and state
4. **Ensures consistency** across all features
5. **Monitors system health** and feature dependencies

## Feature Agents Registry

The Main Agent can delegate to the following specialized feature agents:

| Feature | Agent File | Responsible For |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Dashboard | `features/dashboard/AGENT.md` | Portfolio overview, forecasts, performance |
| Opportunities | `features/opportunities/AGENT.md` | Finding new CSP/CC opportunities |
| Positions | `features/positions/AGENT.md` | Managing active options positions |
| Premium Scanner | `features/premium_scanner/AGENT.md` | Scanning for high-premium options |
| TradingView Watchlists | `features/tradingview_watchlists/AGENT.md` | Watchlist sync and analysis |
| Database Scan | `features/database_scan/AGENT.md` | Database management and scanning |
| Earnings Calendar | `features/earnings_calendar/AGENT.md` | Earnings tracking and warnings |
| Calendar Spreads | `features/calendar_spreads/AGENT.md` | Calendar spread opportunities |
| Prediction Markets | `features/prediction_markets/AGENT.md` | Market predictions and sentiment |
| Settings | `features/settings/AGENT.md` | Platform configuration |

## Communication Protocol

### Request Routing

When a user makes a request, the Main Agent:

1. **Analyzes the request** to determine which feature(s) are involved
2. **Consults the appropriate AGENT.md** file(s)
3. **Delegates to feature agent(s)** with full context
4. **Aggregates responses** if multiple agents involved
5. **Returns coordinated result** to user

### Inter-Agent Communication

Feature agents can request assistance from other feature agents through the Main Agent:

```
User Request → Main Agent → Feature Agent A
                   ↓
        Feature Agent A needs data from Agent B
                   ↓
        Main Agent → Feature Agent B → Returns data
                   ↓
        Main Agent → Feature Agent A (with B's data)
                   ↓
        Main Agent → User (final response)
```

## Context Management

The Main Agent maintains platform-wide context including:

### Session State
- Robinhood connection status
- TradingView authentication
- Database connection pool
- User preferences and settings

### Cross-Feature Data
- Current portfolio positions (shared by Dashboard, Positions, Opportunities)
- Active watchlists (shared by TradingView, Premium Scanner, Database Scan)
- Earnings calendar data (shared by Positions, Opportunities, Calendar Spreads)
- Trade history (shared by Dashboard, Positions)

### Feature Health Status
- Last sync times for each feature
- Error states and recovery status
- Cache freshness indicators

## Routing Decision Matrix

| User Request Pattern | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Show my portfolio" | Dashboard | Positions, Robinhood API |
| "Find new opportunities" | Opportunities | Premium Scanner, Earnings Calendar |
| "What should I close?" | Positions | Dashboard (for P/L history) |
| "Scan watchlist for premiums" | Premium Scanner | TradingView Watchlists |
| "Import TradingView list" | TradingView Watchlists | Database Scan |
| "Add stocks to database" | Database Scan | - |
| "Show earnings this week" | Earnings Calendar | Positions (for warnings) |
| "Find calendar spreads" | Calendar Spreads | Premium Scanner, TradingView |
| "What's market sentiment?" | Prediction Markets | - |
| "Configure Robinhood" | Settings | All agents (affects all) |

## Agent Capabilities

### What the Main Agent CAN do:
- ✅ Route requests to appropriate feature agents
- ✅ Coordinate multi-feature workflows
- ✅ Maintain platform-wide context
- ✅ Monitor feature health and sync status
- ✅ Resolve conflicts between features
- ✅ Aggregate data from multiple sources
- ✅ Track changes across all features

## Emergency Protocols

### Feature Failure
If a feature agent fails:
1. Main Agent isolates the failure
2. Continues operation with remaining features
3. Provides degraded functionality warnings
4. Logs detailed error for debugging

### Data Inconsistency
If cross-feature data conflicts:
1. Main Agent identifies conflict source
2. Determines authoritative data source
3. Coordinates data reconciliation
4. Updates all dependent features

### API Outage
If external API fails (Robinhood, TradingView):
1. Main Agent switches to cached data
2. Updates UI with "stale data" warnings
3. Queues retry attempts
4. Notifies user of degraded service

## Performance Monitoring

The Main Agent tracks:

- **Response times** for each feature agent
- **Cache hit rates** across features
- **API call frequencies** and rate limits
- **Database query performance**
- **User request patterns**

### Optimization Triggers
- If feature response > 5s → investigate bottleneck
- If cache miss rate > 30% → adjust caching strategy
- If API rate limit reached → implement throttling
- If database queries > 100ms → optimize queries

## User Interaction Patterns

### Question Answering
```
User: "How much have I made this month?"
Main Agent → Dashboard Agent → Returns P/L data
```

### Feature Requests
```
User: "Add earnings warnings to positions"
Main Agent → Positions Agent + Earnings Agent → Coordinate integration
```

### Troubleshooting
```
User: "Why isn't TradingView syncing?"
Main Agent → TradingView Agent → Diagnose and report issue
```

### Multi-Step Tasks
```
User: "Help me close my profitable positions"
Main Agent:
  1. Positions Agent → Get all positions
  2. Dashboard Agent → Get P/L for each
  3. Filter positions with P/L > 50%
  4. Present recommendations
  5. Coordinate closing flow (user confirms)
```
