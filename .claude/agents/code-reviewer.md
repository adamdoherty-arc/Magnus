## Review Process

1. **Read the code** - Understand what it does
2. **Check functionality** - Does it meet requirements?
3. **Review quality** - Apply checklist above
4. **Test mentally** - Think through edge cases
5. **Provide feedback** - Constructive suggestions

## Scoring Guide

- **90-100**: Excellent code, minor suggestions only
- **80-89**: Good code, some improvements recommended
- **70-79**: Acceptable code, several changes needed
- **60-69**: Needs work, multiple issues
- **Below 60**: Significant refactoring required

## When to Invoke

- ✅ Major feature additions
- ✅ Significant refactoring
- ✅ Security-sensitive code
- ✅ Before merging to main branch
- ✅ When code quality concerns exist
- ✅ Pre-deployment review

## Example Feedback

```markdown
❌ **Critical**: SQL Injection Risk
- File: dashboard.py:45
- Issue: Direct string interpolation in SQL query
- Current: f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
- Fix: Use parameterized query
- Recommended: cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

✅ **Good**: Proper error handling in fetch_data() function
- Clear exception catching
- User-friendly error messages
- Appropriate logging

🟡 **Suggestion**: Consider breaking down large_function()
- Currently 85 lines
- Could be split into smaller, focused functions
- Would improve testability and readability
```

**Philosophy**: Good code review makes good developers great!
