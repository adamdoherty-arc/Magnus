# Auto-Commit Safety Feature

## Overview
The orchestrator now automatically commits QA-validated changes to prevent data loss from git operations gone wrong.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Execution
After every code change, the orchestrator:
1. ✅ Runs QA validation checks
2. ✅ If QA passes → Auto-commits the changes
3. ✅ If QA fails → Leaves changes uncommitted for manual review

### 2. Commit Message Format
```
chore: <description> (<features>)

✅ QA Validation: PASSED
📁 Files modified: <count>

Modified files:
  - file1.py
  - file2.py

QA checks run: <checks>

🤖 Auto-committed by Orchestrator to prevent data loss

### 3. Safety Features
- **No destructive commits**: Uses `--no-verify` to skip hooks if needed
- **Git repo detection**: Only commits if in a valid git repository
- **Change verification**: Verifies changes exist before committing
- **Timeout protection**: All git operations have timeouts to prevent hangs
- **Error logging**: All errors are logged for debugging

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable
In `.claude/orchestrator/config.yaml`:
```yaml
post_execution:
  enabled: true
  auto_commit: true  # Set to false to disable auto-commit
```

### When Auto-Commit Happens
Auto-commit triggers when:
- ✅ Post-execution QA is enabled
- ✅ QA validation passes
- ✅ `auto_commit` config is `true` (default)
- ✅ Changes are detected in the working directory

### When Auto-Commit Does NOT Happen
- ❌ QA validation fails
- ❌ `auto_commit` is disabled
- ❌ Not in a git repository
- ❌ No changes detected
- ❌ Git operations fail

## Benefits

### 1. Data Loss Prevention
**Problem Solved**: Git operations like `reset --hard` can destroy uncommitted work.

**Solution**: Every QA-validated change is immediately committed, creating a safety checkpoint.

### 2. Automatic Recovery Points
Each auto-commit creates a recovery point. If something goes wrong:
```bash
# View recent auto-commits
git log --oneline | grep "Auto-committed by Orchestrator"

# Recover from a specific commit
git show <commit-sha>:file.py > file.py
```

### 3. Complete Audit Trail
Every change is tracked with:
- Timestamp
- QA validation status
- Files modified
- Feature context

## Examples

### Example 1: Normal Workflow
```
User: "Fix the theta decay dropdown overlap"
↓
Claude makes changes to 2 files
↓
Orchestrator runs QA → PASSED
↓
Auto-commit: "chore: Fix theta decay dropdown overlap"
↓
Changes safely in git history
```

### Example 2: QA Failure
```
User: "Add horizontal lines for spacing"
↓
Claude makes changes
↓
Orchestrator runs QA → FAILED (horizontal lines forbidden)
↓
NO auto-commit (changes stay uncommitted)
↓
User can manually review and fix
```

### Example 3: Recovery After Git Reset
```
Git operation destroys work
↓
Check reflog and dangling commits:
  git reflog
  git fsck --lost-found
↓
Find auto-commit with changes:
  git show <commit-sha>
↓
Recover files:
  git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
```

## Manual Operations

### View Auto-Commit History
```bash
# Show all auto-commits
git log --oneline --grep="Auto-committed by Orchestrator"

# Show details of latest auto-commit
git log --grep="Auto-committed by Orchestrator" -1 --stat
```

### Disable Auto-Commit Temporarily
```python
from .claude.orchestrator.main_orchestrator import get_orchestrator

orchestrator = get_orchestrator()
orchestrator.config["post_execution"]["auto_commit"] = False
```

### Test Auto-Commit
```bash
cd .claude/orchestrator
python main_orchestrator.py --qa file1.py file2.py
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Auto-Commit Enabled
Unless you have a specific reason, keep `auto_commit: true`. It's a safety net.

### 2. Review Auto-Commits Periodically
Check auto-commit messages to understand what changes were validated:
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="Auto-committed" | head -10
```

### 3. Squash Before Push
Before pushing to remote, squash auto-commits into meaningful commits:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~10  # Squash last 10 commits
```

### 4. Trust QA Validation
Auto-commits only happen when QA passes. If QA is passing bad code:
- Fix the QA checks
- Don't disable auto-commit

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Commit Not Working?
Check:
1. Is `post_execution.auto_commit` set to `true` in config?
2. Is QA validation passing?
3. Are you in a git repository?
4. Check logs: `.claude/orchestrator/orchestrator.log`

### Too Many Auto-Commits?
This is normal and safe. Squash before pushing:
```bash
git rebase -i origin/main
```

### Want to Disable?
Set in config:
```yaml
post_execution:
  auto_commit: false
```

## Technical Details

### Implementation
See: `.claude/orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py`
- `post_execution_qa()` - Triggers auto-commit
- `_auto_commit_changes()` - Handles git operations
- `_generate_commit_message()` - Creates descriptive messages

### Git Commands Used
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir        # Check if in repo
git status --porcelain         # Check for changes
git add <files>                # Stage files
git commit --no-verify -m ""   # Create commit
git rev-parse HEAD             # Get commit SHA
```

### Error Handling
All git operations have:
- 5-10 second timeouts
- Capture output for logging
- Exception handling
- Graceful failure (doesn't crash orchestrator)

## FAQ

**Q: Will this create too many commits?**
A: Yes, but that's intentional. Each commit is a safety checkpoint. Squash before pushing.

**Q: Can I customize commit messages?**
A: Yes, modify `_generate_commit_message()` in `main_orchestrator.py`.

**Q: What if auto-commit fails?**
A: Changes remain uncommitted. Check logs for the error. Your work is still safe.

**Q: Does this affect git hooks?**
A: Uses `--no-verify` to skip hooks. Pre-commit hooks shouldn't block safety commits.

**Q: Can I recover from `git reset --hard`?**
A: Yes! Auto-commits are still in reflog and fsck can find dangling commits.

## Lessons Learned

This feature was added after a `git reset --hard` destroyed hours of uncommitted work. The orchestrator had to use `git fsck --lost-found` to recover dangling commits from a stash.

**Never again.** Every QA-validated change is now safely committed.
