## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher
- Redis server
- Chrome/Chromium (for TradingView automation)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WheelStrategy.git
cd WheelStrategy
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# Windows
setup_postgres.bat

# Linux/Mac
./setup_postgres.sh
```

Or manually create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE magnus;
```

Then run the schema setup scripts in `sql/` directory.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=magnus
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Robinhood Configuration (Optional)
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your@email.com
ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET=your_mfa_secret

# TradingView Configuration (Optional)
TRADINGVIEW_USERNAME=your@email.com
TRADINGVIEW_PASSWORD=your_password
TRADINGVIEW_SESSION_ID=auto_generated

# API Keys (Optional - for enhanced data)
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_key
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0
```

### Step 6: Start Redis Server

```bash
# Windows (if installed via Chocolatey or MSI)
redis-server

# Linux
sudo systemctl start redis

# Mac
brew services start redis
```

## Quick Start

### Start the Dashboard

```bash
# Windows
start_dashboard.bat

# Linux/Mac
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

### Sync TradingView Watchlists (Optional)

```bash
python src/tradingview_api_sync.py
```

This syncs all your TradingView watchlists automatically. If your session expires, it will open a browser for you to re-authenticate.

### Connect to Robinhood (Optional)

1. Navigate to the Settings page in the dashboard
2. Enter your Robinhood credentials
3. Click "Connect to Robinhood"
4. Your positions and account data will sync automatically

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

All configuration is managed through environment variables in the `.env` file:

#### Required Variables

- `DB_HOST` - PostgreSQL hostname (default: localhost)
- `DB_PORT` - PostgreSQL port (default: 5432)
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (default: magnus)
- `DB_USER` - Database user
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password

#### Optional Variables

- `ROBINHOOD_USERNAME` - Robinhood account email
- `ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD` - Robinhood account password
- `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET` - Two-factor authentication secret (TOTP)
- `TRADINGVIEW_USERNAME` - TradingView account email
- `TRADINGVIEW_PASSWORD` - TradingView account password
- `TRADINGVIEW_SESSION_ID` - Auto-generated session token
- `FINNHUB_API_KEY` - Finnhub API key for enhanced market data
- `POLYGON_API_KEY` - Polygon.io API key for options data

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They are already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use strong passwords** - Especially for database and brokerage accounts
3. **Enable MFA** - Two-factor authentication for Robinhood
4. **Rotate API keys** - Regularly update API keys and tokens
5. **Limit database access** - Use restricted database users for the application
6. **Review logs** - Monitor `logs/` directory for suspicious activity

## Usage Examples

### Find Premium Opportunities

```python
from src.premium_scanner import PremiumScanner
from src.tradingview_db_manager import TradingViewDBManager

# Get symbols from your TradingView watchlist
manager = TradingViewDBManager()
symbols = manager.get_watchlist_symbols('NVDA')

# Scan for premiums
scanner = PremiumScanner()
opportunities = scanner.scan_premiums(
    symbols=symbols,
    max_price=50,
    min_premium_pct=1.0,
    dte=30
)

# Display top 10 opportunities
for opp in opportunities[:10]:
    print(f"{opp['symbol']}: {opp['premium_pct']:.2f}% premium")
```

### Analyze Position with AI

```python
from src.ai_trade_analyzer import AITradeAnalyzer

analyzer = AITradeAnalyzer()

# Analyze a CSP position
analysis = analyzer.analyze_csp(
    symbol='NVDA',
    strike=135,
    expiration='2025-11-15',
    premium=250,
    current_value=50,
    days_to_expiry=21
)

print(analysis['recommendation']['action'])
print(analysis['recommendation']['reason'])
```

### Access Robinhood Data

```python
from src.robinhood_integration import RobinhoodIntegration

rh = RobinhoodIntegration()
rh.login()

# Get account balance
balance = rh.get_account_balance()
print(f"Buying power: ${balance['buying_power']}")

# Get current positions
positions = rh.get_positions()
for pos in positions:
    print(f"{pos['symbol']}: {pos['quantity']} shares")
```
