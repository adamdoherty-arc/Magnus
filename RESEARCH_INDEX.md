## Implementation Timeline

### Week-by-Week Breakdown
**Weeks 1-4:** Foundation (Qdrant, embeddings, hallucination detection)
**Weeks 5-8:** Adaptive systems (Adaptive-RAG, reflection, preferences)
**Weeks 9-16:** Knowledge integration (Neo4j, hybrid search)
**Weeks 17-24:** Advanced learning (LangGraph, fine-tuning)
**Weeks 25-36:** Specialization (FinGPT, multi-modal)

**Total: 36 weeks (9 months to full production)**

### Accelerated Path (6 months)
Skip Phase 4.2 (fine-tuned embeddings) - use pre-trained
Skip Phase 5.3 (multi-modal) - implement in v2.0
Focus on Phases 1-3 + basic FinGPT fine-tuning

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Data Migration**: Test on 10% of data first
- **Scalability**: Pre-plan partitioning for 100M+ vectors
- **Integration**: Use modular design, test each component
- **Hallucinations**: Add human review layer initially

### Business Risks
- **Timeline**: 2-week buffer built into schedule
- **Skills**: Budget for contractor support
- **Compliance**: Legal review before production

## FAQ

**Q: Why replace ChromaDB?**
A: Limited scalability (millions not billions), no advanced filtering, local-only limits distributed deployment. Qdrant is 4x faster with enterprise features.

**Q: Is FinGPT better than GPT-4?**
A: On finance tasks yes (20% better), cheaper (97% less), but smaller context. For general tasks GPT-4 is better. Recommendation: FinGPT for finance, GPT-4 for research.

**Q: Can we skip Neo4j and just use vector search?**
A: Can start with just vectors, but knowledge graphs add 20-30% accuracy on complex multi-hop queries. Worth adding in Month 3.

**Q: How much training data do we need for fine-tuning?**
A: 1000+ examples minimum for embeddings, 2000+ for LLM. Can start with 500 examples and improve iteratively.

**Q: What if development takes longer than 6 months?**
A: Built-in 2-week buffers. Can parallelize some phases. Use agile approach with bi-weekly sprints.

**Q: Is open-source or commercial solution better?**
A: Open-source (Qdrant, Milvus, Neo4j, Llama) gives control and lower cost. Commercial (Pinecone) easier but higher cost. Recommendation: Open-source for financial services (compliance, customization).
