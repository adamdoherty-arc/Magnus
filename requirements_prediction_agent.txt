# Prediction Agent Requirements
# Multi-sector prediction markets system
# These are in addition to base requirements.txt

# Core ML libraries (already in requirements.txt, listed here for reference)
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# Documentation
sphinx>=7.2.0            # Documentation generation
sphinx-rtd-theme>=2.0.0  # ReadTheDocs theme

# Optional: Model monitoring
mlflow>=2.9.0            # Model tracking and versioning
evidently>=0.4.0         # ML model monitoring

# Optional: Advanced calibration
netcal>=1.3.5            # Advanced calibration methods

# Optional: Visualization
seaborn>=0.13.0          # Statistical visualization
plotly>=5.18.0           # Interactive plots (already in requirements.txt)

# Optional: Performance optimization
joblib>=1.3.0            # Parallel processing
numba>=0.58.0            # JIT compilation for numerical code

# Note: Install base requirements first:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Then install prediction agent extras:
#   pip install -r requirements_prediction_agent.txt
#
# Or install minimal version (no optional packages):
#   pip install scikit-learn>=1.3.0
#
# The system will work without optional packages but with reduced functionality.
